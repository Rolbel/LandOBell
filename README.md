## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
A bank where I store my various projects 
I'm Rolando, a cybersecurity student at DeVry University with a passion for programming in Python. 
I love working on projects that enhance my skills in cybersecurity tools and enjoy creating apps that are versions of paid tools. 

## About Me

I'm currently pursuing an Associate Degree in Cybersecurity and Networking at DeVry University. 
I believe in the power of continuous learning and always seek new challenges to expand my knowledge and experience in the field.

## Projects
Color Chooser App - This tool uses the tkinter `colorchooser` module to select a color. The selected color is saved in a history panel and displayed in an entry field, allowing users to easily copy the RGB code.
